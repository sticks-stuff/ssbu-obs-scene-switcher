# ssbu-stream-automation

Uses my fork of [smush_info](https://github.com/sticks-stuff/smush_info) to automated various stream things

- Changes OBS scenes based on the game
- Hide TSH overlay when the number of human players is not 2
- Loads set in TSH based in-game tags
- Auto flips the player positions in TSH to align them with the game
- Automatically updates the score in TSH on game end
- Dumps timestamps of sets to file
